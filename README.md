# SmugMug Downloader
Download all of the pictures from a SmugMug user, including password-protected users (you must know the password). This method is slightly inefficient, but works without requiring a SmugMug API key or any other information.

## Installation
* Install Python 3
* Clone this repository or download it as a zip
* Install the requirements:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* NOTE: If you are on Linux, you will probably need to type `pip3` and `python3` instead

## Usage
* Run `python smdl.py -u USERNAME` and it will begin downloading your pictures into separate folders in the default output directory. The username is what is found in the URL, i.e. USERNAME.smugmug.com.
* Some SmugMug sites are organized with [folders and hierarchy](https://www.smugmughelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/18212469747604-Organize-with-folders-and-hierarchy); if you would like to restrict your download to certain folders, you can directly put the relevant path into the username (USERNAME.smugmug.com/a/b/c would become `-u USERNAME/a/b/c`).
* To specify the output directory, use the `-o` flag: `python smdl.py -u USERNAME -o output`
* If the user requires an unlock password, you have following two options:
  - Specify the password: `python smdl.py -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD`. This works best if 2FA is not enabled.
  - Sign in from your web browser, then copy over the SMSESS cookie. In Google Chrome, you can view your cookies by pressing Ctrl-Shift-I, then go to the Application tab, go to the Cookies dropdown, and click on https://USERNAME.smugmug.com. Then copy the value of the SMSESS cookie. You can then paste this cookie as an argument: `python smdl.py -u USERNAME -s xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
* For a full list of command-line options, run `python smdl.py -h`, or see below:
